PredictionIO-Java-SDK Examples
=====================

Install
--------

First edit the class files to replace the API Keys and API Urls with your test server, else you will run into problems.

To build these examples you'll need Maven 3.x.x and run in the root directory (ie: the directory you initially
checked the SDK in or within each examples main directory):

            mvn clean install

Usage
--------

Make sure you have added in your own API Key and URL into the files before compiling. Then just run the created JARs in
the target directory to see sample output.
